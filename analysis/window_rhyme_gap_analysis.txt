Key observations
----------------
1. CMU coverage gap is the dominant blocker (~53% of missing items).
2. K1/K2 equality check removes many recognisable “-o” endings
   (pinto, shinto, gringo), even though Datamuse confirms them.
3. Datamuse itself omits numerous phrases/names; additional data sources
   or manual seeding would be required to mirror the RhymeZone list.
4. Multi-word list currently enforces total syllables ≤ target; relaxing
   this would allow phrases like “been known” (3 syllables) if desired.

Recommended actions
-------------------
1. Loosen CMU slant retrieval: rely on final vowel/tail analysis instead
   of strict K1/K2 equality so Datamuse-proven matches are retained.
2. Integrate an expanded phonetic lexicon or ingest high-priority names/
   phrases from RhymeZone into `words_index.sqlite`.
3. Supplement Datamuse data with additional endpoints or curated
   multi-word phrase lists to reduce dependence on their coverage.
4. Review syllable cap rules for multi-word results to determine whether
   longer phrases should be permitted on a per-feature basis.

Tooling provenance
------------------
- Datamuse query: `fetch_datamuse_comprehensive('window')`
- CMU lookup: `words_index.sqlite`
- Comparison script: ad-hoc Python run in PowerShell (see session history)
